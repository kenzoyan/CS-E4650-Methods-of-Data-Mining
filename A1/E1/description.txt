The data is derived from the Rat data (Exercise 1) after handling
missing values, normalizing organ weights and tail length and removing
some rats with erroneous measurements (some outliers and possibly
errors still exist). In addition, some codes of categorical features
or other special codes have been changed. The changes are described
below:

id - rat id
day - date of death (1-365) or a new special code "400" for freezer rats (date
  unknown)
weight, gender - like in original data
liverind, heartind, appind - normalized weights of organs (heart, liver,
  appendix)
femstate - if the rat was pregnant (1), nursing (2), pregnant and nursing
  (3), or neither (4). A special code -1 for male rats.
gonfatind, batind - normalized weights of two fat types
sulcer - stage of stomach ulcer, like in original data
kmethod - new codes for killing method: 1, 2 or 6
tailind - normalized tail length
blength - body length
place - new codes for places/groups (1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9). Rats with place
  codes 1-3 are wild rats and with 4-9 laboratory rats.
year - last digit of the year or a special code 15, if year unknown (freezer
  rats)
ADWBind, gonind - two welfare indices, like in original data
BMI - body mass index
