rattrans.txt

The data contains only seected features of the ratdataNormChecked.csv
that have been binarized. The numerical features have been discretized
manually, by choosing somehow good looking cut-off points (not necessarily
optimal, since there are often many laternatives).

The data is presented in a transaction form.

Attributes:
- ratid (not needed in rule discovery, but doesn't harm, helps to
  identify rats if needed; note that each id is now a binary attribute)
- summer if day 116...300 and winter if day 1...115 or 301...365
- freezer if day=0
- weightlow if weight<=162 and weightnormal otherwise (these probably
  correspond to puppies/young and adult rats)
- non-mother-female, mother-female and male derived from features
gender and femstate (you could keep gender and motherhood  separate)
- liversmall if liverind<=0.037 and liverlarge if liverind>0.064
- pregnant and nursing from femstate
- batlow if batind<=0.00067 and bathigh if batind>0.00184
- tailshort if tailind<=0.74 and taillong if tailind>0.85
- place1,..., place9:  one binary attribute for each place
- wild if place=1-3, and lab otherwise
- adrenalsmall if ADWBind<=0.21 and adrenalarge if ADWBind>0.48
- BMIsmall if BMI<=0.47 and BMIlarge if BMI>0.75
